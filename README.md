# NON-STATIONARY-CONTEXTUAL-BANDIT
Assume you have a list of slot machines with different win rates. The win rates are not stationary (i.e they can change from one moment to the next). Also assume that you can observe things about
the machines (their height, color, etc). This program implements a non statiory contextual bandit algorithm to find the slot machine with the highest win rate as fast as possible.
Since it's just a demo, there are only 3 slot machines
