# NON-STATIONARY-CONTEXTUAL-BANDIT
Assume you have a list of slot machines with different win rates. The win rates are not stationary (i.e they can change from one moment to the next). Also assume that you can observe things about
the machines (their height, color, etc). This program implements a non statiory contextual bandit algorithm to find the slot machine with the highest win rate as fast as possible and creates a plot of the result.
Since it's just a demo, there are only 3 slot machines. To simulate the non stationary nature of the slot machines, one of the win rates is changed in the middle of the program trying to find the best machine.
